  <h2>Nathri Jacobs</h2>
    <h4>About Me</h4>
    <p><i>"Life is not a matter of holding good cards, but sometimes playing a poor hand well"</i> - <b>Jack London</b></p>
    <p>Who am I? I'm someone who enjoys learning and doing something new even if it's a bit out of my comfort zone. I enjoy Video
      Games and playing with Computers and occasionally trying something new in the kitchen. I enjoy reading a good book
    in my spare time or just playing on my guitar. </p>
    <p>I strive towards being Punctual, Responsible and Reliable. I'm an honest person who believes that respect is
      not something that needs to be earned, Respect should be something everyone should have unless given a reason for it to be taken away.</p>
      <p>I'm still new to coding but I am capable of doing quite a lot with just what I know and I am constantly
        learning, improving and building on what I need to. Currently the only programming languages I know are HTML/CSS, Javascript and Python3</p>
        <p>I enjoy meaningful, interesting and knowlegable conversations so if you would like to talk about complex
          things like building rockets or simple things like how to tie your shoelaces or even if you're just
          interested in hanging out and playing video games then feel free to contact me.<p/>
